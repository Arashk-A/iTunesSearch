"description":"An Apple Books Classic edition.<br /><br />What happens when feelings get in the way of order? What is the price of perfecting society? Yevgeny Zamyatin’s We, like many of the dystopian novels that came after it, plays on our fears of being watched and controlled, of human emotions being criminalized. A lively critique of authoritarianism, We holds the honor of being the first book banned by the Soviet government. Zamyatin managed to get a copy of his novel to the United States, where it was published in 1924.<br /><br />We is set in a future world where there are no individual names—only numbers. The book opens with D-503 sharing the news that the spaceship he’s been building is complete. The United State, which rules Earth, can now find other planets with which to share their “mathematically infallible happiness.” But then, D-503 meets I-330, and despite not being assigned to her, he falls in love. It makes no sense: I-330 smokes, drinks, encourages imagination—all very illegal acts that would result in public execution. So, what will D-503 say when I-330 asks for help with mounting a rebellion against the United State? Pick up a dystopian novel that predates bestsellers like 1984, The Handmaid’s Tale, and Brave New World."},

Wally finner inspiration och kraft i Wallis Simpsons övertygelse att kärleken betyder allt och inleder ett förhållande med en man vars ovillkorliga kärlek blir som en befrielse."},

"description":"A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It's our nature. \n<br />Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they're enabling countless new tribes to be born - groups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming.<br /><br />And so the key question: Who is going to lead us?<br /><br />The Web can do amazing things, but it can't provide leadership. That still has to come from individuals - people just like you who have a passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips.<br /><br />If you think leadership is for other people, think again - leaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.<br /><br />If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a \"sheepwalker\" - someone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don't do very well these days.<br /><br />Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers....It's not easy, but it's easier than you think."},

Looking at creatures from across the animal kingdom as well as major human studies, Why We Sleep delves into everything from what really happens during REM sleep to how caffeine and alcohol affect sleep and why our sleep patterns change across a lifetime, transforming our appreciation of the extraordinary phenomenon that safeguards our existence.<br /><br /> Includes a bonus PDF of graphs and diagrams.<br /><br />'Astonishing ... an amazing book ... absolutely chocker full of things that we need to know' Chris Evans<br /><br />'Matthew Walker is probably one of the most influential people on the planet' Evening Standard<br /><br /> 'Startling, vital ... a life-raft' Guardian<br /><br /> 'A top sleep scientist argues that sleep is more important for our health than diet or exercise' The Times<br /><br /> 'Passionate, urgent . . . it had a powerful effect on me' Observer<br /><br />©2017 Matthew Walker (P)2017 Penguin Books Ltd"},

"description":"<b><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES <\/i>AND <i>USA TODAY<\/i> BESTSELLER&#xa0;• ONE OF <i>TIME<\/i>’S 100 MUST-READ BOOKS OF 2022 • <\/b>In an inspiring follow-up to her critically acclaimed, #1 bestselling memoir <i>Becoming, <\/i>former First Lady Michelle Obama shares practical wisdom and powerful strategies for staying hopeful and balanced in today’s highly uncertain world. <\/b><br /> &#xa0;<br />There may be no tidy solutions or pithy answers to life’s big challenges, but Michelle Obama believes that we can all locate and lean on a set of tools to help us better navigate change and remain steady within flux. In<i> The Light We Carry,<\/i> she opens a frank and honest dialogue with readers, considering the questions many of us wrestle with: How do we build enduring and honest relationships? How can we discover strength and community inside our differences? What tools do we use to address feelings of self-doubt or helplessness? What do we do when it all starts to feel like too much?<br />&#xa0;<br />Michelle Obama offers readers a series of fresh stories and insightful reflections on change, challenge, and power, including her belief that when we light up for others, we can illuminate the richness and potential of the world around us, discovering deeper truths and new pathways for progress. Drawing from her experiences as a mother, daughter, spouse, friend, and First Lady, she shares the habits and principles she has developed to successfully adapt to change and overcome various obstacles—the earned wisdom that helps her continue to “become.” She details her most valuable practices, like “starting kind,” “going high,” and assembling a “kitchen table” of trusted friends and mentors. With trademark humor, candor, and compassion, she also explores issues connected to race, gender, and visibility, encouraging readers to work through fear, find strength in community, and live with boldness.<br />&#xa0;<br />“When we are able to recognize our own light, we become empowered to use it,” writes Michelle Obama. A rewarding blend of powerful stories and profound advice that will ignite conversation, <i>The Light We Carry<\/i> inspires readers to examine their own lives, identify their sources of gladness, and connect meaningfully in a turbulent world."},

"description":"<b>In this urgent, authoritative book, Bill Gates sets out a wide-ranging, practical--and&#xa0;<i>accessible<\/i>--plan for how the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid a climate catastrophe.<\/b><br /><br />Bill Gates has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change. With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet's slide to certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal.<br /><br />He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions--suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.<br /><br />As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.<br /><br /><b>*This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF of&#xa0;charts, graphs, and pictures from the book.<\/b>"},

"description":"<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES<\/i> BESTSELLER • This instant classic explores how we can change our lives by changing our habits.<br /><br />NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY<i> The Wall Street Journal • Financial Times<br /><br /><\/i><\/b>In <i>The Power of Habit, <\/i>award-winning business reporter<i> <\/i>Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. Distilling vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives that take us from the boardrooms of Procter &amp; Gamble to the sidelines of the NFL to the front lines of the civil rights movement, Duhigg presents a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential. At its core, <i>The Power of Habit<\/i> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, being more productive, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. As Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.<br /><br /><b>With a new Afterword by the author<\/b><br /> &#xa0;<br /> “Sharp, provocative, and useful.”<b>—Jim Collins<\/b><br /> &#xa0;<br /> “Few [books] become essential manuals for business and living. <i>The Power of Habit <\/i>is an exception. Charles Duhigg not only explains how habits are formed but how to kick bad ones and hang on to the good.”<b>—<i>Financial Times<\/i><\/b><br /> &#xa0;<br /> “A flat-out great read.”<b>—David Allen, bestselling author of <i>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity<\/i><\/b><br /> <b> <\/b><br /> “You’ll never look at yourself, your organization, or your world quite the same way.”<b>—Daniel H. Pink, bestselling author of <i>Drive <\/i>and<i> A Whole New Mind<\/i><\/b><br /><br /> “Entertaining . . . enjoyable . . . fascinating . . . a serious look at the science of habit formation and change.”<b>—<i>The New York Times Book Review<\/i><br /><\/b>"},
